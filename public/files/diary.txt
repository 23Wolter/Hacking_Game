Dear diary, 

Today it is 482 days since the first infected person was discovered. 
The virus has now spread to the entire population of the world. 
When you LOOK at everybody, you can see they all fear getting infected by the deadly Albani virus. 

I have locked myself INSIDE THE house, to avoid getting infected. 
But I don't know how much longer I can last the SOURCE of my loneliness. 

I have almost no food left, except "Brunsviger"... It seems like there is some sort of CODE here.
The entire movie business was HIT hard, and is now closed down, so the only movies available are "Olsen Banden".
And the stores ran out of toilet paper months ago, 
The rich people, who bought it all during the great outbreak shopping spree, now CONTROL all the toilet paper.
I have started to use my own blend of copier paper soaked in olive oil, 
but I long for the soft feeling of a piece of Lambi against my cheeks,
which can be bought from the great tp-cartels at Langelinje for 1.000 danish crowns... for one piece.

We can only hope that someone will soon discover a cure for this terrible disease,
but until then, I will fill my tub and indulge in a long hot bath of hand sanitizer PLUS soap, and survive yet another day...


This is my private script I am working on for a movie. 
Sometimes, the script can tell you anything you need to know.

Hope U liked it, diary.
